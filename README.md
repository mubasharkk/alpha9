Notes / Task

·         Read the txt files

·         Split the files into words and remove numbers and punctuation

·         Store the words in an appropriate data structure

·         query the data structure you created to answer the queries.

·         First start with a naive approach that works and optimize later

·         What is the time complexity of your solution? Does it scale with more books?

·         If you have some concerns about your implementation or you have a better solution write the better solution in a comment if you do not implement it.

·         Your solution does not have to be perfect but you need to know the limitations and comment them

·         Use python 2.7.x and only facilities from the standard library. Do not use any kind of DBMS (sqlite included)

·         If you have any questions feel free to contact us.
